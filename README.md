# Pervasive Code's Java Concurrent Utilities

This library contains classes for running and timing concurrent tasks.

## Overview of included classes

Javadocs are available on `javadoc.io`:

[![Javadocs](https://www.javadoc.io/badge/com.pervasivecode/concurrent-utils.svg)](https://www.javadoc.io/doc/com.pervasivecode/concurrent-utils)

See the separate [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) file for a description of what interfaces and classes are included.
(Overview content is taken from class Javadoc comments, so there's no need to read both.)

## Including it in your project

Use groupId `com.pervasivecode`, name `concurrent-utils`, version `0.9` in your build tool of choice.


### Gradle Example

If you are using Gradle 4.x - 5.x, put this in your build.properties file:

```
// in your build.gradle's repositories {} block:
    mavenCentral();

// in your build.gradle's dependencies {} block:
    implementation 'com.pervasivecode:concurrent-utils:0.9'

    // or, if you prefer the separated group/name/version syntax:
    implementation group: 'com.pervasivecode', name: 'concurrent-utils', version: '0.9'
```


## How to use it in your code

See the [Example Code][] section in [OVERVIEW.md](OVERVIEW.md) for details.

## Contributing

See [DEVELOPERS.md](DEVELOPERS.md) and [GRADLE_INTRO.md](GRADLE_INTRO.md) if you want to build and hack on the code yourself.
